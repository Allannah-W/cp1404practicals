# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

90%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Monday nights from approx. 6:30 - 9:30pm

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've been able to submit all required tasks on time thus far.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to finish watching all the lectures before attempting to complete the practical, as at times it has made it more difficult attempting to skim the videos to find the information needed as opposed to getting the information in full.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I need to review my final programs more thoroughly to identify where aspects could be condensed to make them easier to read/ alter. I could also be more thoughtful in choosing variable names within my programs to reduce confusion.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I've found it easy to find information about syntax for the built-in python functions
